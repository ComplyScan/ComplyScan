# Changelog

## Unreleased

Target: 0.2.0

### Added

- Aggregated AI provider and framework inventory with representative locations.
- Bounded discovery, nested-repository boundaries, Git-tracked-only scans, exclusions, and terminal progress.
- Stable finding fingerprints, reasoned suppressions, and source-free baselines.
- SARIF 2.1.0 output and a reusable GitHub code-scanning action.
- Cross-platform release archives, SHA-256 checksums, and build attestations.
- Maintained AI applicability and technical risk assessments for ComplyScan itself.
- Typed AI-component signals for recognised dependencies, imports, endpoints, and environment-variable access.
- A labelled positive and hard-negative evaluation corpus with enforced precision and recall thresholds.
- A structured `inventory` command with terminal and versioned JSON reports.
- `generate ai-system` and `generate risk-assessment` commands that create reviewable, inventory-prefilled governance scaffolds.
- `scan --changed-since <git-ref>` and a matching GitHub Action input for pull-request scope, including local staged, unstaged, and untracked files.
- Explicitly enabled, loopback-only Ollama review of sanitised deterministic findings using schema-constrained output.
- Advisory observations in terminal, JSON, and SARIF without changing deterministic findings or exit status.
- Guided multi-system profiles covering intended purpose, regions, roles, use-case domains, people, data, deployment, oversight, and attributable human applicability decisions.
- Conservative EU AI Act scope and possible high-risk screening in `profile show`, terminal scans, and JSON reports.
- `profile setup` for adding or replacing system context in an existing configuration.

### Changed

- Terminal findings are emitted live while rules run.
- Scan-wide AI analysis is shared across rules to avoid repeated repository work.
- AI discovery now requires technical evidence instead of matching plain provider names.
- Changed-since scans keep documentation and risk-evidence checks repository-wide while scoping code rules to changed files.
- Forced configuration updates are validated and written atomically while preserving file permissions.

### Fixed

- Public module path and installation flow.
- Secret detection no longer treats ordinary hyphenated words ending in `sk-...` as credentials.
- ComplyScan's detector signatures and synthetic fixtures no longer appear as AI components in its self-inventory.
